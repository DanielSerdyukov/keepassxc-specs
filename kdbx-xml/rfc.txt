                      KeePass2 XML Payload Format
                            keepass2-xml-rfc

Abstract

   This document describes the XML payload format used in KDBX 3.1 and
   4.0 containers.  KDBX is an encrypted, XML-based container format for
   secure password storage used by KeePass 2.x, KeePassXC and various
   other password managers.  This document only describes the actual XML
   payload and not the KDBX container format itself.

Status of This Memo

   This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is
   published for informational purposes with the goal to support
   development of KDBX-based password management applications.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes the payload format used in KDBX (version 3.1
   and 4.0) files.  The payload is encoded as XML ("Extensible Markup
   Language" [1]).

   KDBX file format versions 3.1 and 4.0 use the same XML structure with
   minor differences in the tags supported.  A note is added where KDBX
   3.1 and 4.0 differ.

   The XML payload itself is mostly self-contained, but may reference
   data from the outer KDBX container.  A note is given where this is
   the case.

2.  Security Considerations

   KDBX is an encrypted container format.  The security of the XML
   payload described in the document depends on the strength of the
   cipher and passphrase / key file used for encrypting the
   encapsulating KDBX container.

   In addition, all security considerations for XML [1] apply as well,
   including the use of recursive XML entities, which can consume an
   arbitrarily large amount of memory on the user's system during
   parsing.
